# LD36-Warmup
Ludum Dare 36 Warmup Weekend

## Spiderfling
Fling spiders into the pen and into each other. Keep them out of the pits - three spider deaths and you're out. 
Each living spider earns you points, so build up a big population and keep them safe!

[Play Here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36-warmup/?action=preview&uid=17811)

###How to play:

1. Drag your mouse from the edge of the screen toward the bucket and release to fling a spider.
2. The longer the line, the farther the fling.
3. Spiders that hit each other may get twisted up.
4. Spiders that walk into a wall will scramble around.
5. Spiders that touch a pit will fall in - you only get three
6. Every second you earn 1 point per spider in your bucket.
