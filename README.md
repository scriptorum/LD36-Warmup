# LD36-Warmup
Ludum Dare 36 Warmup Weekend

## Spiderfling
Fling spiders into the pen and into each other. Keep them out of the pits - three spider deaths and you're out. 
Each living spider earns you points, so build up a big population and keep them safe!

###How to play:

1. Move mouse to outside of the circle
2. Drag the mouse to inside the circle
3. Release
4. The longer the line, the harder the fling
5. Spiders that hit each other will rebound
6. Spiders that walk into a wall will scramble around
7. Spiders that touch a pit will fall in - you only get three
8. Earn 1 point per spider per second
